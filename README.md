# Introduction to tractometry data analysis

The notebook included in this repository was written to give you an overview of the computational work that we do at the [University of Washington Neuroinformatics R&D group](https://neuroinformatics.uw.edu/). It is intended as an introduction to our work and as a starting point for joining the group.

The notebook assumes proficiency in Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. We recommend looking up tutorials for these tools if you are unfamiliar with any of them, such as [Neuroimaging and Data Science](https://neuroimaging-data-science.org/root.html).
Chapters 2, 3, 5 and 6 of this book are particularly useful if you do not have
familiarity with git or Python.

The provided notebook has some Python dependencies, which many be installed using the following command:

    pip install pandas numpy afqinsight seaborn scikit-learn

Once you are done with this tutorial, if you are interested in learning more about interacting with MRI data more directly, these tutorials may be useful:
